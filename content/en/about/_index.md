As ..an engineer in the handling and processing of specific English words and symbols on the Internet.. , I have done many interesting things, But few articles are produced.

When I was in high school or college, I occasionally wrote something in the QQ Space, and later I learned to build some blogs.

The first blog is on `wordpress`, Tencent Cloud. However, because the database was also in it, once the server expired and many things written were gone...

Later I learned about `markdown`. I have also set up a few blogs, but I feel unable to write.

I am actually more accustomed to `wordpress`, probably because of the back-end engineer. But, speed and bloat are indeed worth mentioning.

Two days ago, I stumbled upon a free space that natively supports `hugo` deployment. I stumbled upon a new theme of `hugo` by chance and started this blog on a whim.

## Technology and life

This is something that makes me very entangled, that is, whether technical articles should be put together with daily life. I don’t like to write technical articles not because I don’t like sharing, but because it will make me feel very busy.

The original idea was to manage two blogs independently, then two styles, two content and two git frameworks must be managed independently. Let's forget it...

Therefore, this is a life-oriented technology blog, which will be updated occasionally, and there may be more life-related things.

Now, use classification for blog management, and when it matures, you can see I will use tags for classification.

## Thanks

Unlike `wordpress`, all open source projects including `hugo` are provided free of charge.

This blog drives by [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is built on ~~[vercel](https://vercel.com)~~ [`Github Pages`](https://pages.github.com), use [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) for secure processing and CDN. Pictures and other media are managed by [acexy](https://imgs.acexy.cn), [sm.ms](https://sm.ms), [gitee](https://gitee.com), etc. The theme uses [`MemE` theme](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme/), which is fresh to bursting and powerful, and it is also highly recommended for programmers who want to have their own blog [theme] Author's blog](https://io-oi.me).

No more, let's update something in future.

### Small supplement
After running on `vercel` for a week, I found that `Baidu` and `Google` have no interest in my blog.. I decided to deploy to `github pages`.
