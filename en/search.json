[{"categories":null,"content":"As ..an engineer in the handling and processing of specific English words and symbols on the Internet.. , I have done many interesting things, But few articles are produced.\nWhen I was in high school or college, I occasionally wrote something in the QQ Space, and later I learned to build some blogs.\nThe first blog is on wordpress, Tencent Cloud. However, because the database was also in it, once the server expired and many things written were gone…\nLater I learned about markdown. I have also set up a few blogs, but I feel unable to write.\nI am actually more accustomed to wordpress, probably because of the back-end engineer. But, speed and bloat are indeed worth mentioning.\nTwo days ago, I stumbled upon a free space that natively supports hugo deployment. I stumbled upon a new theme of hugo by chance and started this blog on a whim.\nTechnology and life This is something that makes me very entangled, that is, whether technical articles should be put together with daily life. I don’t like to write technical articles not because I don’t like sharing, but because it will make me feel very busy.\nThe original idea was to manage two blogs independently, then two styles, two content and two git frameworks must be managed independently. Let’s forget it…\nTherefore, this is a life-oriented technology blog, which will be updated occasionally, and there may be more life-related things.\nNow, use classification for blog management, and when it matures, you can see I will use tags for classification.\nThanks Unlike wordpress, all open source projects including hugo are provided free of charge.\nThis blog drives by hugo and is built on vercel Github Pages, use CloudFlare for secure processing and CDN. Pictures and other media are managed by acexy, sm.ms, gitee, etc. The theme uses MemE theme, which is fresh to bursting and powerful, and it is also highly recommended for programmers who want to have their own blog [theme] Author’s blog](https://io-oi.me).\nNo more, let’s update something in future.\nSmall supplement After running on vercel for a week, I found that Baidu and Google have no interest in my blog.. I decided to deploy to github pages.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"ABOUT","uri":"/en/about/"}]
